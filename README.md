# My Visual Piano User Guide

[Landing Page](https://visualpiano.tk/) 

Abstract: According to the ALS Association, an average of 15 people are diagnosed with ALS every day.  ALS is just one disabling condition that can impair someone’s creative abilities. My Visual Piano is a real-time, live instrument that provides a way for people in this community to express their creativity exclusively using their eyes. It is accessible to musicians hoping to continue their passion or novices wishing to learn piano in a different way. People who have limited mobility or have completely lost the ability to use their arms, hands, or fingers can play piano live – hands and hassle-free.
